# Configuration

Pixelfed uses the ```.env``` environment configuration file, it is created automatically by the installer, otherwise you need to copy the ```.env.example``` file to ```.env``` manually. Some of these values do not exist in .env.example but you can add them to .env.

::: warning
Whenever you edit the ```.env``` file, you must run ```php artisan config:cache``` in the root directory for the changes to take effect.
